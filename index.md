# About Me


I am a recent graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi with an Integrated Dual Degree in Mathematics and Computing. Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Neuroinformatics Group, Bielefeld University. My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning and its applications in developing intelligent agents.

## Featured Projects

#### Hopper Behavior Modification
Developed a novel MuJoCo dataset by modifying hopper reward structures, creating scenarios of varied locomotion (slower hops, reverse movement, stationary positions). 
- [üé• Demo](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1e6jph-_49LnZMyFoIZvSZe4GQLZQ7AIG)
- **Skills**: Reward Engineering

#### Data Free Model Extraction
As a part of Inter IIT Tech Meet, implemented model extraction techniques for video classification models (SwinT, MoViNets) using Kinetics datasets in Black Box and Grey Box settings.
- [üíª Code](https://github.com/COPS-IITBHU/Model-Extraction-Attacks-Video-Classification)
- **Skills**: Model Extraction, Generative Modelling

#### Dopamine-Gated Random Network Distillation(RND) for Adaptive Exploration
Developed Dopamine-Gated RND (DG-RND), a framework that improves exploration by dynamically adjusting novelty bonuses using a gating mechanism inspired by dopaminergic signals. The method significantly outperformed standard RND on Montezuma's Revenge, discovering more rooms and achieving higher rewards.
- [üíª Code](https://github.com/AmoghRaut/SurpriseModulatedExploration)
- **Skills**: Reinforcement Learning, Intrinsic Motivation, Exploration Algorithms, PPO, Atari Benchmarks
