# About Me


I am a recent graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi with an Integrated Dual Degree in Mathematics and Computing. Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Neuroinformatics Group, Bielefeld University. My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning and its applications in developing intelligent agents.

## Featured Projects

#### Hopper Behavior Modification
As part of an exploratory research effort, I created a unique dataset in the MuJoCo environment
by modifying the reward structure of hopper. This dataset includes scenarios where the hopper
hops slower, hops in reverse, and stands still.
- [üé• Demo](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1e6jph-_49LnZMyFoIZvSZe4GQLZQ7AIG)
- **Skills**: Reward Engineering

#### Data Free Model Extraction
As a part of Inter IIT Tech Meet, we at IIT Varanasi developed a model extraction method for
video classification models like SwinT and MoViNets trained on Kinetics 400/600 dataset in Black
Box setting (Full dataset abstraction) and Grey Box setting (Using only 5% of dataset)
- [üíª Code](https://github.com/COPS-IITBHU/Model-Extraction-Attacks-Video-Classification)
- **Skills**: Model Extraction, Generative Modelling

#### AI Mathematics Olympiad
Implemented 4-bit quantized QwQ-32B-Preview model for mathematical reasoning tasks.
- **Skills**: Quantization, Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
